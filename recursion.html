	    What Recursion Means to me
	</h3>
	To me recursion is the idea of something telling itself to do something.
	</br></br>
	<h3>
	Examples of Recursion
	</h3>
	A good example of recursion is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Fractals</a> which by definition are recursive. Fractals are mathematical which contain a smaller version of themself. One of these fractals is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle">Sierpiński's Triangle.</a> 
	<h3>
	S-S-S Strategy	
	</h3>
	The S-S-S Strategy is a way of visualizing the recusion of something. The steps of the strategy simplify to: <ul> 
		<li>Simplify the function to more easily understand it</li> 
		<li>Substiute the base case with its value</li>
		<li>Solve in reverse. Start from the end and work back to the start</li>
	</ul>
	For my code:
		<ul>
		<li>Simplified, my code take a single triangle and splits it into three</li>
		<li>The base case for my code is when the triangle has been split 8 times</li>
		<li>Solved in reverse, you would take a completly split triangle and turn each of the sets of three triangles into one larger triangle</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>
		Divide and Conquer Strategy
	</h3>
	Another strategy for understanding recursion is to imagine it like a tree with your starting function as the base of the tree and everytime a function is called that becomes a different branch.</br> This can be very useful for visualizing the path a program can take and the performance effects of the recursion.
